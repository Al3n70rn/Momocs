\description{
\code{Coo} class is a "super class" for \link{Out}, \link{Opn} and \link{Ldk} classes,
for handling \bold{closed outlines}, \bold{open outlines} and \bold{configuration of landmarks}, respectively.
}
\details{
This class allows to recycle most of the methods, since all of them apply on
(x; y) coordinates stored \code{$coo} slot. All of them also have a \code{$fac} component,
yet not mandatory, to store grouping informations (also called classifiers). Others slots
may be present in certain classes.

In other words, \code{Out}, \code{Out} and \code{Ldk} classes
are all, primarily, \code{Coo} objects on which we define generic \emph{and}
specific methods.

More, generally, see \link{Out}, \link{Opn} and \link{Ldk} for documentation on these classes.
And Momocs' vignette for more detailed informations on the Momocs' "architecture".

Finally, note that if you used Momocs before version <0.9, and/or if you have read the JSS paper,
you are probably looking for \link{Out}.

You can access all the methods available for Coo objects with \code{methods(class=Coo)}.
Among them, some are not individually documented but you will find an exhaustive list
below, as well as in individual  Momocs' vignettes.
