\description{
\code{Coo} class is a super class for \link{Opn} and
\link{Out} classes, \bold{open outlines} and \bold{closed
outlines}, respectively.
}
\details{
It allows to recycle most of the methods, since both of
them apply on \eqn{(x; y)} coordinates. In other words,
\code{Opn} and \code{Out} classes are all, primarily,
\code{Coo} objects on which we define generic \emph{and}
specific methods.

If you used Momocs before version <1.0, or if you have read
the JSS paper, you are probably looking for \link{Out}.

More, generally, see \link{Opn} and \link{Out} for
documentation on these classes.
