\title{Extract outline coordinates from a single .jpg file}
\usage{
import.jpg1(jpg.path, auto.notcentered = FALSE, threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{jpg.path}{a vector of paths corresponding to the .jpg files to import}

\item{auto.notcentered}{logical if TRUE random locations will be used until
one of them is (assumed) to be within the shape (because of a black pixel);
if FALSE a \link{locator} will be called, and you will have to click on a
point within the shape.}

\item{threshold}{the threshold value use to binarize the images. Above, pixels
are turned to 1, below to 0.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to \link{read.table}, eg. 'skip', 'dec', etc.}
}
\value{
a matrix of (x; y) coordinates that can be passed to Out
}
\description{
Used to import outline coordinates from .jpg files. This function is used for
single images and is the core function of \link{import.jpg}
}
\details{
jpegs can be provided
either as RVB or as 8-bit greylevels or monochrome. The function binarizes
pixels values using the 'threshold' argument. It will try to start apply
the \link{import.Conte} algortih of outline extraction from the center of
the image and 'loinking' downwards for the first black -> white 'frontier' in
the pixels. This point will be the first of the outlines and it may be useful
if you align manually the images and if you want to retain this information
in the consequent morphometric analyses. If the point at the center of the
image is not within the shape, ie is "white" you have two choices defined by
the 'auto.notcentered' argument. If it's TRUE, some random starting points
will be tried until on of them is "black" and within the shape; if FALSE
you will be asked to click on a point within the shape.
