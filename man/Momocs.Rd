\description{
Momocs aims to provide a complete and convenient
toolkit for morphometrics. It is intended for scientists interested in
describing quantitatively the shape, and its variations, of the objects they
study. In the last decade, R has become the open-source lingua franca
for statistics, and morphometrics known its so-called 'revolution'.
Nevertheless, morphometric analyses still have to be carried out using
various software packages, for which source code is mostly unavailable
or copyrighted. Moreover, existing software packages cannot be extended
and their bugs are hard to detect and thus correct. This situation
is detrimental to morphometrics; time is wasted, analyses are restricted
to available methods, and last but not least, are poorly reproducible.
This impedes collaborative effort both in software development and
in morphometric studies. By gathering the common morphometric approaches
in an open-source environment and welcoming contributions, Momocs is an
(work-in-progress) attempt  to solve this twofold problem and to push morphometrics
one step further. It hinges on the core functions published
in the book \emph{Morphometrics using R} by one of us (Claude, 2008), but has been further
extended to allow other shape description systems. So far, configurations
of landmarks, outlines and open outline analyses, along with some facilities
for traditional morphometrics have been implemented. Prior to analysis,
Momocs can be used to acquire and manipulate data or to import/export
from/to other formats. Momocs also has the facility for a wide range of
multivariate analyses and production of the companion graphics.
Thus a researcher will find that just a few lines of code will provide
initial results, but the methods implemented can be finely tuned
and extended according to the user's needs.
