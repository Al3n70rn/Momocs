\description{
\code{Coe} class is a "super class" for \link{OutCoe} \link{OpnCoe} and \link{LdkCoe} classes,
matrices of coefficients (in their \code{$coe} slot), along with other informations,
(e.g. an inherited \code{$fac}) obtained with morphometrics methods on
\link{Out}, \link{Opn} and \link{Ldk} objects.
}
\details{
This classes allows to recycle most of the methods, since both of them apply on
matrices of coefficients. In other words, \code{OutCoe}, \code{OpnCoe} and \code{LdkCoe}
classes are all, primarily, \code{Coe} objects on which we define generic
\emph{and} specific methods.

All these classes contain a \code{$coe} slot where the coefficients are stored,
and can be accessed.

More, generally, see \link{OutCoe}, \link{OpnCoe} and \link{LdkCoe}
for documentation on these classes.

# to see all methods for Coo objects.
methods(class="Coe")

data(bot)
bot.f<- eFourier(bot, 12)
bot.f
class(bot.f)

# if you want to work directly on the matrix of coefficients
bot.f$coe

data(olea)

class(op)
op$coe # same thing

data(wings)
wp <- fgProcrustes(wings, tol=1e-4)
wp
class(wp) # for Ldk methods, LdkCoe objects can also be considered as Coo objects
# so you can apply all Ldk methods available.
wp$coe # Procrustes aligned coordinates
