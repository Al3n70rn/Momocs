\title{Momocs' "oscilloscope" for periodic functions.}
\usage{
coo.oscillo(coo, rug = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
cols = col.gallus(2), nb.pts=12)
}
\arguments{
\item{coo}{A list or a matrix of coordinates.}

\item{rug}{\code{logical}. Whether to display a pseudo rug, that indicate if
the derivate is positive.}

\item{legend}{\code{logical}. Whether to add a legend.}

\item{cols}{A \code{vector} of two colors for lines.}

\item{nb.pts}{\code{integer}. The number or reference points, sampled
equidistantly along the curvilinear abscissa and added on the oscillo
curves.}
}
\description{
Shape analysis deals with curve fitting, whether \eqn{x(t)} and \eqn{y(t)}
positions along the curvilinear abscissa or radius/tangent angle variation.
We may need to represent these single or double periodic functions that are
ajusted by Fourier-based method. \code{coo.oscillo} and \code{coo.oscillo1}
compute and provide standardized plot when given a matrix of coordinates or
a vector, respectively. These functions are mainly used for development
purpose but are included in the package.
