\title{Some vector utilities.}
\usage{
vecs.param(r1, i1, r2, i2)
}
\arguments{
\item{r1}{the "real" part of the first vector, i.e. difference in
x-coordinates.}

\item{i1}{the "imaginary" part of the first vector, i.e. difference in
y-coordinates.}

\item{r2}{the "real" part of the second vector, i.e. difference in
x-coordinates.}

\item{i2}{the "imaginary" part of the second vector, i.e. difference in
y-coordinates.}
}
\value{
A list with two components: \code{r.norms} the ratio of (norm of
vector 1)/(norm of vector 2) and \code{d.angle} the signed angle 'from' the
first 'to' the second vector.
}
\description{
Returns ratio of norms and signed angle between two vectors provided as four
numeric.
