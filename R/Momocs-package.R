#' Momocs
#'
#' Momocs aims to provide a complete and convenient
#' toolkit for morphometrics. It is intended for scientists interested in
#' describing quantitatively the shape, and its variations, of the objects they
#' study. In the last decade, R has become the open-source lingua franca
#' for statistics, and morphometrics known its so-called 'revolution'.
#' Nevertheless, morphometric analyses still have to be carried out using
#' various software packages, for which source code is mostly unavailable
#' or copyrighted. Moreover, existing software packages cannot be extended
#' and their bugs are hard to detect and thus correct. This situation
#' is detrimental to morphometrics; time is wasted, analyses are restricted
#' to available methods, and last but not least, are poorly reproducible.
#' This impedes collaborative effort both in software development and
#' in morphometric studies. By gathering the common morphometric approaches
#' in an open-source environment and welcoming contributions, Momocs is an
#' (work-in-progress) attempt  to solve this twofold problem and to push morphometrics
#' one step further. It hinges on the core functions published
#' in the book \emph{Morphometrics using R} by one of us (Claude, 2008), but has been further
#' extended to allow other shape description systems. So far, configurations
#' of landmarks, outlines and open outline analyses, along with some facilities
#' for traditional morphometrics have been implemented. Prior to analysis,
#' Momocs can be used to acquire and manipulate data or to import/export
#' from/to other formats. Momocs also has the facility for a wide range of
#' multivariate analyses and production of the companion graphics.
#' Thus a researcher will find that just a few lines of code will provide
#' initial results, but the methods implemented can be finely tuned
#' and extended according to the user's needs.
