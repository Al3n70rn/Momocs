Description: Aiming to provide a complete and convenient toolkit for morphometrics, Momocs is intended for
            scientists interested in describing quantitatively the shape, and its variations, of the objects
            they study. In the last decade, R has become the open-source lingua franca for statistics, and
            morphometrics known its so-called 'revolution'. Nevertheless, morphometric analyses still have to be
            carried out using various software packages, for which source code is mostly unavailable or
            copyrighted. Moreover, existing software packages cannot be extended and their bugs are hard to
            detect and thus correct. This situation is detrimental to morphometrics; time is wasted, analyses
            are restricted to available methods, and last but not least, are poorly reproducible. This impedes
            collaborative effort both in software development and in morphometric studies. By gathering the
            common morphometric approaches in an open-source environment and welcoming contributions, Momocs is
            an (work-in-progress) attempt to solve this twofold problem and to push morphometrics one step
            further. It hinges on the core functions published in the book Morphometrics using R (Claude, 2008),
            but has been further extended to allow other shape description systems. So far, configurations of
            landmarks, outlines and open outline analyses, along with some facilities for traditional
            morphometrics have been implemented. Prior to analysis, Momocs can be used to acquire and manipulate
            data or to import/export from/to other formats. Momocs also has the facility for a wide range of
            multivariate analyses and production of the companion graphics. Thus a researcher will find that
            just a few lines of code will provide initial results, but the methods implemented can be finely
            tuned and extended according to the user's needs.
