Description: Momocs is intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics, the
    quantitative analysis of form. It aims at gathering the most common
    approaches: traditional morphometrics and global descriptors of shape,
    open and closed outlines, and configuration of landmarks into the same
    environment.
    It primarily hinges on the core functions developed in the
    book 'Morphometrics with R' by Julien Claude (2008), extend them
    graphically and statistically, using the same grammar.
    From data acquisition and import from other morphometric formats,
    to display, handling, calibration and morphometric calculations on which
    to apply an array of statistical analyses, Momocs intends to provides a
    complete, convenient and extendable toolkit to specialists within every
    field that are, or may be, interested in integrating shape in their
    researches.
