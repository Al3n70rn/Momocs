Description: Momocs is intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics, the
    quantitative analysis of form. It aims, eventually, at gathering the most
    common approaches: traditional morphometrics, global descriptors, open
    outlines, closed outlines and configuration of landmarks into the same,
    open-source, environment. It hinges on the core functions developed in the
    book 'Morphometrics with R' by Julien Claude (2008), extend them
    graphically and statistically, using the same, unified and extendable,
    grammar. From import from other morphometrics format or data acquisition,
    to display, handling, calibration and calculations on morphometrics
    datasets on which to apply an array of statistical analyses, Momocs intends
    to provides a complete, convenient and extendable toolkit to specialists
    within every field that are, or may be, interested in integrating shape in
    their researches.
