Morphometrics is the statistical description of shapes, in other words methods that turn $(x, y)$ coordinates into quantitative variables.

Of course, the raw data may differ in their nature: outlines, curves, configuration of landmarks, and once you have quantitative variables you have a bunch of multivariate analyses at your fingertips.

Whatever the morphometric approach you are using (say outline analysis) you have very *generic* needs that you share with other approaches (say configuration of landmarks), for instance centering and plotting your shape dataset. But you have have very *specific* needs, for instance calculation Elliptical Fourier Transform, which makes no sense on configuration of landmarks.

Momocs use a simple scheme of classes to handle the different morphometrics approaches and the methods associated with:

* **Coo**rdinates are primarily `Coo` objects but also of class:
    + `Out` for **out**lines
    + `Opn` for **op**e**n** outlines
    + `Ldk` for configurations of **l**an**d**mar**k**s
* **Coe**fficients are primarily `Coe` objects but also of class:
    + `OutCoe`
    + `OpnCoe`
    + `LdkCoe`
    
They are all described in their own helpfiles (*e.g.* `?Out`).
