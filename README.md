Momocs, morphometrics using R
======

Momocs is an [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics, the quantitative analysis of form. It aims at gathering the most common approaches: traditional morphometrics, global descriptors, open outlines, closed outlines and configuration of landmarks into the same, open-source, environment. _And_ using the same, simple and easy-to-learn, open-source, and extendable grammar both for the user and programmers. Momocs hinges on the core functions developed in the must-have book _[Morphometrics with R](http://www.springer.com/statistics/life+sciences,+medicine+%26+health/book/978-0-387-77789-4)_ by [Julien Claude](http://www.isem.univ-montp2.fr/recherche/equipes/biologie-du-developpement-et-evolution/personnel/claude-julien/) (2008), wraps them into the same coding grammar, and extends them both graphically and statistically.

Use Momocs
--------
__Get the last version:__
* First get `devtools` with `install.packages("devtools")`
* Then, download and load the very last version with:
```
devtools::install_github("vbonhomme/Momocs", build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(Momocs)
````

__Note that:__
* The current [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Momocs/index.html) version (0.2) has been published in [_Journal of Statistical Software_](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v56/i13/paper)
* Since then, Momocs has been almost entirely rewritten and considerably enlarged.
* A CRAN version will be released when most of the features planned below (*) will be part of Momocs.
* Also, some tutorials are on their way

Features
--------
__Data acquisition + Babel__
* Outline extraction
* Landmark definition on outlines* (via [StereoMorph](https://github.com/aaronolsen/StereoMorph))
* Open curves digitization with bezier curves* (via [StereoMorph](https://github.com/aaronolsen/StereoMorph))
* Import from `.nts`, `.tps`, `PAST`, `.txt`, etc.
* Export to `.txt`, etc.

__Outline analysis__
* Elliptical Fourier analysis (`efourier`)
* Radius Variation Fourier analysis (`rfourier`)
* Tangent Angle Fourier analysis (`tfourier`)
* Calibration for all methods (`calibrate_reconstructions`, `calibrate_deviations`, `calibrate_harmonicpower`)

__Open-outlines__
* Natural (raw) polynomials (`npoly`)
* Orthogonal (Legendre) polynomials (`opoly`)
* Discrete Cosinus Transform (`dfourier`)
* Same calibration methods as above

__Configuration of landmarks__
* Full Generalized Procrustes Adjustment (`fgProcrustes`)
* Resistant Fit Procrustes Adjustments*
* Sliding semi-landmarks*

__Traditional morphometrics and global shape descriptors__
* Some built-in facilities for multivariate analysis*
* A long list of shape scalars (eg. eccentricity, rectilinearity, etc.)

__Data handling__
* `filter`, `select`, `slice`, `mutate` ala [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/)
* `split` according to a factor (eg. a 2D view)
* `combine` several 2D views
 
__Multivariate analysis__
* Mean shape (groupwise) calculations (`mshapes`)
* Principal component analysis (`PCA`)
* Multivariate analysis of variance (`MANOVA` + pairwise testing `MANOVA_PW`)
* Linear discriminant analysis (`LDA`)
* Hierarchical clustering (`CLUST`)
* Regression trees*
* K-means*
* Multidimensional scaling*
* Allometry / modularity testing*

__Graphical methods__
* Elegant ggplot2 plots
* Morphological spaces, when possible, for multivate analyses (and for combined views)
* Thin plate splines and variation around deformation grids
* Family pictures and quick inspection of whole datasets (`panel`, `stack`, `plot`, `radar`, etc.)
